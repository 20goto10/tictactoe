# tictactoe

A Clojure project designed to teach me Clojure.

## Usage

Currently if you "lein run" you will see a board populated randomly with
X, O, or _ (blank), and a report on whether any of those have achieved a
straight line across the board width (ordinarily 3 in Tic-Tac-Toe).

A little part of this code was adapted from someone else's Tic-Tac-Toe
Clojure project.

I will be attempting to convert this into Pente.

## Sample output

(with board size set to 4)

```
 X │ X │ O │ O 
───┼───┼───┼───
 O │ X │   │ O 
───┼───┼───┼───
 X │   │   │ O 
───┼───┼───┼───
 X │ X │ X │ X 
O:  false
X:  true
_:  false
```
